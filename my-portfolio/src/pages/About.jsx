      <p className='about-text'>I am a software engineer with a background in culinary arts. After losing employment due to the pandemic, I finally had a chance to pursue a dream of mine, web development. The more time I spend coding the more I love it. The skills I have learned being a chef such as attention to detail and the ability to think under pressure has helped me in my pursuit of a new career in tech. Though I am familiar with building full stack applications, my passion is in the front-end. In the future I picture myself creating beautiful websites with fun and easy to use UIs.
