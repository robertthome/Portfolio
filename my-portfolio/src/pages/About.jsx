      <p className='about-text'>I am a Software Engineer with a background in Culinary Arts. This last year has been challenging but I am also fortunate since I finally had a chance to pursue a dream of mine, web development. The skills I have learned from my career as a chef, such as attention to detail and the ability to think under pressure, has helped me in my pursuit of a new career in tech. Though I am familiar with building full stack applications, my passion is in front-end development. My goal is to create beautiful and responsive websites that are user friendly. A future goal of mine is to attend college to receive a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
